# get_tweets

This repository is my first in downloading the tweets from Twitter. I used the Twitter API in python and was able to download the tweets. I utilized the code to get the tweets for the hurricane harvey by a small modification to take in the ID's of the past tweets to be extracted.
The code is ready to use, just needs the access and secret keys to be inputed and its good to go. The code can be used to search for a keyword in the tweet and it'll output it in a csv format.
